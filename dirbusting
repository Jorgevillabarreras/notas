So, you got a target web application? Sweet.
The beginning of your enumeration is going to start with Discovery.
In other words, what the heck can I actually view, enumerate, etc?

I will go into Web Application Assessments in much more detail with a sample machine in a future blog post or dedicated page.

For now, export your URL immediately and localize these commands such that they are ready to launch in a *snap*.
Before anything - are you going to be using Seclists? Hope so!

cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git

[Nikto]

[GOBUSTER]
+ We will begin with Gobuster.
export URL="https://example.com/"

+ Here are my localized commands:
BUST DIRECTORIES:
gobuster dir -u $URL -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -l -k -t 30

BUST FILES:
gobuster dir -u $URL -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files.txt -l -k -t 30

BUST SUB-DOMAINS:
gobuster dns -d someDomain.com -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -t 30
--> Make sure any DNS name you find resolves to an in-scope address before you test it.
